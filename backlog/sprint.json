    "sourceBacklog": "bugs.json",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Before the setsid calls in run_agent_process(), check if setsid is available with command -v setsid",
      "Step 2: If setsid is available, use it as currently done",
      "Step 3: If setsid is not available, launch claude directly without setsid (just background with &)",
      "Step 4: Adjust the kill logic at lines 410-412 to handle both cases: with setsid use kill -TERM -- -$pid, without setsid use kill -TERM $pid",
      "Step 5: Test that the help and version commands still work (no setsid needed for those)"
    ],
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "run_agent_process works on systems without setsid (macOS)",
      "On Linux where setsid exists, behavior is unchanged",
      "Agent timeout and kill logic works in both paths",
      "No shellcheck warnings introduced"
