      "Step 1: At the start of cmd_run(), before any sprint begins, run git stash push -u -m 'aishore: pre-sprint stash' if the working tree is dirty, and record that a stash was made",
      "Step 2: Extract the repeated failure-handling block (git checkout/clean/reset/continue) into a handle_sprint_failure() function",
      "Step 3: On sprint failure, the handle_sprint_failure function should reset the working tree and log a warning",
      "Step 4: At the end of cmd_run() (both success and failure paths), if a stash was made, run git stash pop and log that pre-existing changes were restored",
      "Step 5: Add the stash pop to the cleanup path so it runs even on unexpected exits"
