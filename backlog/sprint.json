      "Step 1: At the start of cmd_run() (after line ~654), record a batch_start timestamp using date +%s. Declare two indexed arrays: sprint_results=() and sprint_items=() to track per-sprint outcomes.",
      "Step 2: After each sprint iteration succeeds (line ~728) or fails (lines ~686, ~707, ~719, ~731), append to sprint_results the status ('pass' or 'fail') and to sprint_items the ITEM_ID. Also record per-sprint elapsed time using a per-iteration start timestamp.",
      "Step 3: After the for loop (before stash restore, line ~754), if count > 1, call a new print_batch_summary() function. This function prints a formatted report.",
      "Step 4: print_batch_summary() displays: a header line, a table row per sprint (sprint #, item ID, status, elapsed time), a separator, totals (passed, failed, total elapsed). Use printf for aligned columns.",
      "Step 5: If any sprints failed, append a 'Failed items:' section listing each failed item ID. Read failure reasons from the FAILED_IDS associative array (store reasons instead of just 1).",
      "Step 6: Change FAILED_IDS to store failure reasons: FAILED_IDS[\"$ITEM_ID\"]=\"Implementation failed\" (or 'Validation failed', etc.) instead of just =1. Update skip list logic to still work (check -n instead of value)."
